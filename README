This is a simple game. It's small copy of Wombat-CS test (aero.ca). 
For playing you need 2 joysticks. Now, joystick configuration could be done
by modification of the source (vars.h). 
Keyboard is emulation of Wombat keys, that's way it is a little bit strange:

1: 1
2: 2
3: 3
4: 4
5: q
6: w
7: e
8: r
9: a
0: s
bonus button: 'd', 'f', or 'b'
left arrow: 'z', 'x'
right arrow: 'c', 'v'
exit program: 'ESC'

I suggest small sticks with new keys on old ones.

The goal of the game is to put the yellow cross inside of the blue 
circle (right joystick) and vertical blue lines between pairs of 
vertical yellow lines (left joystick). You can switch Autotrack 
mode on with right joystick trigger. While autotrack is on you shall 
play one of 3 bonus tests (activate with bonus button). Failure of 
autotrack is signalized by red rectangle in the top left corner of 
the screen. While failure you shold deactivate bonus (pressing bonus 
button), switch autotrack off (right joystick trigger) and wait while 
the autotrack is repairing. When repaired, switch it on and continue 
your bonus (with bonus button).
